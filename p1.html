        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

        <p>
            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. 
            On her desk, lying between copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, 
            and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, 
            was a well-thumbed copy of <i>On The Road</i>. It had been Molly’s favorite 
            book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls, 
            the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>

        <p>
            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster 
            with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that “Work is the refuge of 
            people who have nothing better to do.” Although many considered her 
            pioneering work—unraveling the secrets of llama DNA—to be an 
            outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.
